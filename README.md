## Minimal Reproduction For Clerk Support Ticket

I've been running into Errors thrown by clerk when calling auth() within server actions

When reproducing this issue I've realised that the package manager plays a role so pnpm must be used

To reproduce use the following node version and pnpm:
```
node: v20.10.0
pnpm: 8.6.12
```

To set up Clerk and Sentry add the following variables to a .env.local in the root of the project
```
# Clerk vars
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY

# Sentry vars
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
SENTRY_DSN
SENTRY_ORG
SENTRY_PROJECT
```

Then run build commands
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm start`

When activating the server action through the button you should see the following error

` тип Error: Clerk: Unable to decrypt request data, this usually means the encryption key is invalid. Ensure the encryption key is properly set. For more information, see: https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#dynamic-keys. (code=encryption_key_invalid)`
